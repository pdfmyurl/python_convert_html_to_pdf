# Convert HTML to PDF or URL to PDF in Python

The two Python scripts included in this repository are examples that show you how to convert a URL to PDF or HTML to PDF in Pyton.

They both use our [HTML to PDF API](https://pdfmyurl.com/html-to-pdf-api), which uses the PDFmyURL conversion service. This makes sure that your PDFs come out exactly like the webpages look on your screen as we use the latest browser rendering engine.

Please reach out to support@pdfmyurl.com in case you have any questions or remarks.
